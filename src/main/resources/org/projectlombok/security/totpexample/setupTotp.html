			To enable two-factor authentication, you need an authenticator application on your smart phone. For example, the Google Authenticator app:<br />
			<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2">Install Google Authenticator for Android.</a><br />
			<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8">Install Google Authenticator for iPhone / iPad.</a><br />
			<p>
			Start your authenticator application on your smart phone, set up an account, and choose the 'scan a barcode' option.
			<p>
			<img src="/qrcode?key=${key}" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
			<p>
			Enter the code displayed on your device to confirm the setup.
			<p>
			<form class="midPageForm" action="/confirm-totp-setup" method="POST">
				<input name="code" autocomplete="off" placeholder="code" /><br />
				<input type="hidden" name="key" value="${key}">
				<input type="submit" value="Confirm" />
			</form>
			<div class="demoNote">
				You should obviously never give this in a real TOTP application, but as a demo, here are some TOTP codes that your phone would be telling you if you scanned the QR code: <br />
				Correct code: <span> ${correctTotpCode}</span><br />
				If your phone is three minutes ahead: ${threeMinutesOutCode}<br />
				If your phone has the wrong Daylight Savings Time setting: ${hourOutCode}<br />
				<br />
				Give these a try to see what the demo app does. Also, of course, try a random code as well,
				such as 000042. We determined that one by random dice roll, we swear.
